# minimal-devblog
Tiniest devblog software possible!

## Alright

Sooo, yeah. Goals:

* simple software with no fluff
* some nice syntax highlighting for blocks of code, as it's for developers. (I use Prism by Lea Verou)

## Current status

WIP, but it's actually usable. You'll need node & npm. Just clone the repo and:

```
npm install
```

now run the program:

```
node generate.js
```

and afterwards your `dist` folder should contain all the files needed for website. Just configure your server software of choice to point to this folder.

## TODO

List so long I don't even type.
