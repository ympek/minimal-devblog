# It's just an example post

I write this markdown, add some code like here:

```javascript
while (true)
{
  std::cout << "Some nice code block." << std::endl;
}
// oopsie woopsie! Dis program will crash, obviously!
// what can I do???????

try {
  int notToPanic;
  FILE* fopen("unexisting_file");
}
/* etc. etc..... */
```

## I have fun

And stuff... Just write your markdown.

## Tip

Use newest Visual Studio Code for writing markdown. It has great live markdown preview out of the box.
